I am a Computer Science M.Sc. student at **École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne**, with a strong focus on **Machine Learning and Security**. I earned a Computer Engineering B.Sc. at the **Polytechnic University of Turin**, after spending my sophomore year as an exchange student at Tongji University (**同济大学**) in Shanghai, supported by PoliTong scholarship.

I interned at the IT Consulting firm Blue Reply, part of **Reply Group**, working on **RPA** and on the development of a **chatbot**.

I am highly curiosity-driven and my goal is to become an **ML Research Scientist**, after pursuing a Ph.D. in Computer Science.

I attended **Military Navy College** "F. Morosini", in Venice. There, I lead sophomores as **prefect** during my final year, and I received **military training** aboard Italian Navy's units and at Italian Navy's Marine Corps.

I am also swimming, sailing, and travel addicted. I like to call myself a *beta tester*.
