# personal-website-hugo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dedeswim/hugo-personal-website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dedeswim/hugo-personal-website)

My personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io) and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com).
The base theme is [Hugo Coder](https://themes.gohugo.io/hugo-coder/) theme, with some little edits by me. You can find the built static website [here](https://github.com/dedeswim/dedeswim.github.io).
The website repository is automatically updated after every commit here using [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.com/dedeswim/hugo-personal-website).

I used [`cookieless-google-analytics`](https://github.com/Foture/cookieless-google-analytics) by [Bright Future](https://github.com/Foture) to implement cookieless Google Analytics (I know, it's obvious).
